#Are We the Same?
#In the code below, two arrays containing several
#numbers are assigned to two variables, array1
#and array2.
array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]
#Compare array1 and array2 and print
#true or false based on whether they match.

#They should NOT be the same, but two different-ordered
#hashes WOULD be the same bc those are not indexed/ordered.
puts array1==array2
